# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

A web application where students can manage schedule on a daily or monthly basis.

## User stories

<span>1.</span> As a user, I want to add an event to a certain day so that I can view it later in the calendar.</br>
<span>2.</span> As a user, I want to remove an event from a certain day so that I can update my calendar if schedules change.</br>
<span>3.</span> As a user, I want to search for an event that I added so that I can directly access the specific event.</br>
<span>4.</span> As a user, I want to view my schedule in calendar mode so that I can view all events on a monthly basis.</br>
<span>5.</span> As a user, I want to edit the event information so that I can add or remove any detail.</br>
<span>6.</span> As a user, I want to view all tasks for a specific category so that I can only see the events with a certain tag.</br>
<span>7.</span> As a user, I want to add tags to events so that I can specify the category of the event.</br>
