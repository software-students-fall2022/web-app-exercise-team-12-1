<span>3.</span> As a user, I want to be able to search for a specific event in my calender so that I can access its details faster.</br>
<span>4.</span> As a user, I want to be able to view all of my events in a calender so that I can view my entire schedule simultaenously and over the span of the entire month.</br>
<span>5.</span> As a user, I want to be able to edit an event's details so that I can modify an event as needed.</br>
<span>6.</span> As a user, I want to be able to view all the events within a specific category so that I can browse through the needed category and find events within that category more efficiently.</br>
